  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Christopher Umunnakwe</strong> ðŸ‘‹, a passionate and self-driven 
    <strong>Data Analyst</strong> who enjoys uncovering insights hidden in data.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in analyzing and visualizing data using 
    <strong>Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SQL</strong>. 
    I enjoy transforming raw information into clear, actionable insights that help solve 
    real-world problems.

    Iâ€™m constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects and certifications. 
    Recently, I completed a <strong>Data Analysis certification on FreeCodeCamp</strong>, 
    which strengthened my ability to handle complex datasets and create meaningful reports.
